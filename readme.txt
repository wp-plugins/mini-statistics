This plugin is a small and simple Users Statistics and Comments Statistics plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Many times, while maintaining a WordPress website, we need to find basic statistics like user registrations or user comments and also compare them with different years. It can generate Bar-Diagram or Line-Diagram for different years and different months for the no of users registrations and no of users comments posted in the website.

This plugin is very light-weight, just 10kb, and it uses Google Charts API only where it is needed.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip mini-statistics.zip and upload the mini-statistics directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
